/**
 * Configuration file for the plotter, describing enabled components, pins allocation and physical attributes.
 * Notes about pin allocation:
 * - pins 0 and 1 are used by serial link (respectively RX, TX);
 * - pins 11, 12 and 13 are used by ICSP (SD card communication) : respectively MOSI, MISO, SCK ;
 * - pin 14 = pin A0, 15 = A1, 16 = A2, 17 = A3, 18 = A4 and 19 = A5 (on Arduino UNO board).
 * TODO: Make a user friendly window in the DOVBuilder software to build this file (including comments).
